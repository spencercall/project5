   <p>MrBeast is one of most popular channels on YouTube and it's ran by Mr. Beast or others call him Jimmy. He makes video of all kinds of challenges and others things meant to give others money. I love the guy because he gives away most of the money he gained to others. This is the channel's most popular video and it's about Mr. Beast making a real live version of Squid Games.</p>

   <p>America's Funniest Home Videos or AFV is a TV show that I watched since I was a kid and it has it's own YouTube channel. They show different kinds of funny videos and it had made me laugh multiple times. My Mom and I watched it's channel's videos sometimes. This video is about people doing bad ideas even though the title of video said this would go well.</p>
